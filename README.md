# Simon_memory_game
In the Simon Memory Game, there are four colored buttonsâ€”typically red, blue, green, and yellow. The game flashes a sequence of lights in a random order, and the playerâ€™s goal is to repeat that sequence by pressing the colored buttons in the same order. As the game progresses, the sequence gets longer, making it more challenging.
